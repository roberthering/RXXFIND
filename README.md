# RXXFIND
The tool "rxxfind" has been designed for putting together z/OS UNIX security related file structure information in two different ways that can be combined as well. Like "xfind" it can be used efficiently in a z/OS UNIX sysplex sharing environment and only file systems that are owned locally are used for searching.
